# Black Atom

A family of dark and light themes for developer tools. 32 themes across seven collections, each with its own palette
and mood: `default`, `facility`, `terra`, `jpn`, `clay`, `minium`, `mono`. Every theme is defined once and
rendered for each platform through an adapter, so the same colors show up in your terminal, editor,
and everything else you point Black Atom at.

## Layout

- `core/` — theme definitions (`core/src/themes/<collection>/`), the generator CLI
  (`core/src/cli/index.ts`), the adapter schema (`core/adapter.schema.json`), and a preview app
  (`core/monitor/`)
- `adapters/<name>/` — one directory per platform: ghostty, herdr, lazygit, niri, nvim, obsidian,
  tmux, waybar, wezterm, zed
- `livery/` — the desktop app that applies a theme across the tools on a machine. GUI binary
  `livery-gui`, terminal client `livery`
- `website/`, `ui/` — placeholders

## Getting started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nikbrunner/black-atom.git
cd black-atom
deno install
deno task dev           # GUI, monitor, generation watcher, development CLI
deno task check         # Deno checks, Rust format and Clippy (all targets)
deno task test          # Deno and Rust workspace tests
deno task build         # release GUI bundle and CLI
deno task install:macos # build and install app + CLI
```

Generation runs automatically before development, checks, tests, and builds. Rust checks and tests
build the required frontend first. `dev` and `livery-dev` use the invoking shell's home, XDG directories,
and existing configuration. Dev links the launcher into an existing user `bin` directory in `PATH`, so a second
terminal can run `livery-dev list`. Existing commands or another worktree's launcher cause a visible
conflict. The launcher is ready after successful generation and compilation; shutdown removes its
symlink. The installed `livery` command stays independent.

On macOS, the root build produces the `.app` bundle and CLI.

`install:macos` installs `/Applications/livery.app` and `$CARGO_HOME/bin/livery` (default
`~/.cargo/bin/livery`). It builds the macOS app bundle without a DMG and performs no setup or apply.

## Git hooks

Install the standalone [Lefthook](https://lefthook.dev/installation/) binary, then enable hooks explicitly:

```bash
brew install lefthook # macOS; other platforms: see the installation link
deno task install:hooks
```

Pre-commit checks formatting and lint on staged Deno-supported files, respecting Deno exclusions,
plus workspace Rust formatting when Rust files are staged. Checks are read-only;
use `deno fmt` and `cargo fmt` to format explicitly.

Pre-push runs `deno task check`, then `deno task test`. Lefthook skips these jobs when its
push-file detection returns no files. These full tasks generate files and build the frontend.
Review generated changes. Hooks check the current checkout, not snapshots of other refs being pushed. Lefthook temporarily hides and restores unstaged portions of partially
staged files during commit checks. This is not a full checkout snapshot: workspace Rust formatting
also sees other unstaged files. CI runs the full check and test tasks independently.

## Using the themes without livery

Each adapter ships its generated theme files in the same tree. Grab them directly, or use livery
to apply them for you (see below).

**Terminals and multiplexers** (ghostty, tmux, wezterm) read a generated config file from
`adapters/<name>/themes/<collection>/`. See `adapters/ghostty/README.md`,
`adapters/tmux/README.md`, `adapters/wezterm/README.md` for the exact path and how to point the
app at it.

**Editors** (zed, obsidian) take a theme file dropped into the app's own theme directory, or a
setting that points at one. See `adapters/zed/README.md` and `adapters/obsidian/README.md`.

**System tools** (niri, waybar, herdr, lazygit) read a generated config or CSS file. herdr and
waybar share one template across collections instead of one per collection. See
`adapters/niri/README.md`, `adapters/waybar/README.md`, `adapters/herdr/README.md`,
`adapters/lazygit/README.md`.

**Neovim** installs straight from this repo, no livery required. Put `adapters/nvim` on the
runtimepath:

```lua
vim.opt.rtp:prepend("<path>/adapters/nvim")
```

or point your plugin manager at the directory instead. Then, before `:colorscheme`, set
`vim.g.black_atom_core_config` (optional, everything you omit keeps its default):

```lua
vim.g.black_atom_core_config = {
    term_colors = true,
    styles = {
        ending_tildes = false,
        cmp_kind_color_mode = "bg", -- "fg" | "bg"
        dark_sidebars = true,
        dark_floats = true,
        transparency = "none", -- "none" | "partial" | "full"
        diagnostics = {
            undercurl = false,
            background = false,
        },
        syntax = {
            comments = { italic = true },
            keywords = { bold = true },
            functions = {},
            strings = { italic = false },
            variables = {},
            messages = { bold = true },
        },
    },
}
vim.cmd.colorscheme("black-atom-jpn-koyo-dark")
```

Defaults live in `adapters/nvim/lua/black-atom/config.lua`. See `adapters/nvim/README.md` for the
full theme list and plugin support.

## livery

```bash
cd livery && deno task build  # build the app bundle
livery setup                  # detect installed apps, write config
livery apply <theme>          # apply a theme everywhere livery manages
```

The GUI ships as `livery-gui`; the terminal client is `livery`, with a bare `livery` (or `livery apply`
without a theme) opening a theme picker.

## Releases

Releases run through release-please on conventional commits. The repo carries one version for
core, the adapters and livery together, tagged `v*`. Nothing is published yet.

## License

MIT, see `core/LICENSE.md` and the LICENSE files in the adapters that carry one.
