# Black Atom for Herdr

> Cohesive Herdr themes generated from the Black Atom theme system.

## About

This directory is the [Herdr](https://herdr.dev/) adapter for Black Atom. It contains committed
TOML fragments for every Black Atom theme.

Herdr does not load dedicated theme files. Its custom colors live in `[theme.custom]` inside
`~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, so each generated file is a complete managed block that can be copied
into that config. [Livery](../../livery/README.md) is the recommended way to apply and switch these
fragments safely.

## Collections

32 themes across seven collections:

| Collection   | Themes                                                 |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Default**  | dark, dimmed-dark, light, dimmed-light                 |
| **Facility** | dark, dimmed-dark, light, dimmed-light                 |
| **Terra**    | spring, summer, fall, winter (dark/light)              |
| **JPN**      | koyo, sanshoku (dark/light), murasaki-dark, tsuki-dark |
| **Clay**     | dark, light                                            |
| **Minium**   | polymer, viridian (dark/light)                         |
| **Mono**     | dark, dimmed-dark, light, dimmed-light                 |

Generated files live at `themes/<collection>/<theme-key>.toml`.

## Usage

### Livery (recommended)

1. Open Livery settings and enable the Herdr adapter.
2. Set `CONFIG_PATH` to `~/.config/herdr/config.toml` and sync themes.
3. Pick any Black Atom theme in Livery.

Livery replaces only the block between these markers and then runs
`herdr server reload-config`:

```toml
# BEGIN BLACK ATOM LIVERY THEME
# ...generated [theme] and [theme.custom] tables...
# END BLACK ATOM LIVERY THEME
```

If the config already has an unmanaged `[theme]` or `[theme.custom]` table, wrap that theme stanza
with the markers before the first Livery apply. Livery refuses ambiguous marker states rather than
risking unrelated config.

### Manual

Copy one generated file's complete managed block into `~/.config/herdr/config.toml`, replacing the
previous marked block, then reload:

```sh
herdr server reload-config
```

Herdr custom colors are global. Do not enable Herdr's own light/dark theme auto-switch for this
block; switch complete Black Atom variants through Livery instead.

## Development

Requirements: [Deno](https://deno.com/).

```sh
deno task generate  # regenerate committed TOML files
deno task dev       # regenerate on template changes
```

Templates use Eta syntax and semantic Black Atom colors only. `surface_dim` uses `ui.bg.panel`, and
`surface1` is a small blend from `ui.bg.active` toward `ui.fg.disabled`.
