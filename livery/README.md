# livery

> Paint your cockpit.

A desktop app and CLI for applying [Black Atom](../core/) themes across your developer tools. Pick
a theme once, apply it everywhere.

## How it works

Livery embeds every adapter's generated theme files in its binary and unpacks them into
`$XDG_DATA_HOME/black-atom/themes/<adapter>/` (`~/.local/share` if `XDG_DATA_HOME` is unset).
Livery's own settings live in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/black-atom/livery/config.json`.

Each supported app falls into one provisioning class: Linked, Merged, or External. See
[ADAPTERS.md](ADAPTERS.md) for the class definitions and per-app contracts.

## CLI

```sh
livery                       # interactive theme picker (so does `livery apply` alone)
livery apply <theme>         # apply a theme to every enabled app and the system appearance
livery list                  # list every available theme, grouped by collection
livery status                # show the active theme, then each app's enabled, provisioning,
                             #   linked and config state
livery setup [--yes]         # enable detected apps, link their themes, verify config paths,
                             #   then apply a theme (picker, or default-dark under --yes)
livery appearance <dark|light>  # switch the system between dark and light mode
livery nvim-settings         # write stored Neovim plugin settings into nvim's managed Lua block
```

## GUI

`livery-gui` is the Tauri desktop app. Same picker, status, and setup flows as the CLI, in a
window.

## Development

```sh
deno task dev   # from the repo root: GUI, CLI, monitor, generation
deno task test  # from the repo root: prepares frontend, tests Deno and Rust
```

The GUI and `livery-dev` share the environment inherited when development starts, including existing
home and XDG configuration paths. For GUI-only work, `cd livery && deno task dev` starts Tauri.
`deno task airship` wraps the same GUI with the Airship development bridge.

Bundle the desktop app:

```sh
cd livery && deno task build
```

From the root, `deno task build` builds both app and CLI; `deno task install:macos` installs both.
The package-local `install:macos` installs only the app.

Automated tests and agent-run development, setup, and apply commands use temporary fixture homes and
XDG directories. See the Sandbox section in the root `AGENTS.md`.

## Architecture

- **Frontend**: React + TanStack (Router, Store, Query) in a Tauri v2 webview, `livery/src/`
- **Domain logic**: `livery/core/` (crate `livery_core`), no Tauri dependency
- **Tauri shell**: `livery/src-tauri/` (binary `livery-gui`)
- **CLI**: `livery/cli/` (crate `livery-cli`, binary `livery`)

## Logs

Livery writes logs to the platform log directory:

| Platform | Path                                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| macOS    | `~/Library/Logs/industries.black-atom.livery/livery.log`      |
| Linux    | `~/.local/share/industries.black-atom.livery/logs/livery.log` |

Logs rotate automatically at 5 MB. Previous log files are kept alongside the current one.

## Origin of name
